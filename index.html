            <h2>Future Trends in Nanotechnology</h2>
            <div class="trend">
                <h3>1. Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery</h3>
                <img src="https://nanobotmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nano_petrolatum.jpg" alt="Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery" class="trend-image">
                <p>Nanotechnology is transforming healthcare, particularly through targeted drug delivery. Nanoparticles can carry drugs directly to diseased cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissue. This is especially promising for cancer treatments, where traditional therapies often have severe side effects. Beyond drug delivery, nanomaterials are also being used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, offering new ways to heal damaged tissues or even grow replacement organs. Nanotechnology-based diagnostic tools, known as theranostics, are emerging, allowing for real-time monitoring of treatment effectiveness, making personalized medicine more attainable.</p>
